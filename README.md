Using Excel to analyze vehicle emissions data of Battery Electric Vehicles and Internal Combustion Vehicles

According to the International Energy Agency, transportation currently accounts for around one quarter of global energy use and energy related greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately three quarters of these emissions are from road transport. With the rise in demand for mobility, the number of vehicles in the world are projected to more than double before 2050. Because of this, Governments around the world are developing measures aimed at addressing greenhouse gas emissions to make our transportation more sustainable and environmentally friendly. One way to meet the energy demand for transport while reducing CO2 emissions and improving air quality is to embrace a range of smarter vehicles and fuels. Electric vehicles have been long regarded as promising potential long-term solutions to sustainable personal mobility. Although battery electric vehicles in particular, offer zero tailpipe emissions, the production of itâ€™s batteries contributes to most of its greenhouse gas emissions. In this presentation, we will compare the greenhouse gas emissions of battery electrical vehicles and internal combustion vehicles. We hope that this study will shed some light on the true greenhouse gas reductions of Battery electric vehicles.
